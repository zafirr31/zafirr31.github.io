## English
This sprint, I had the fantastic opportunity to be the scrum master in my group. This was a brand new experience for me, and it definitely took my out of my comfort zone. This blog post, I want to explain my experience as a scrum master, aswell as tie together what I learned with the [agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/).

### The Agile Manifesto
The agile manifesto is a short description on an alternative philosophy of software development. In it, there are four basic values. Those values are:

* **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
* **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
* **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
* **Responding to change** over following a plan

These values are what I experienced myself during my time as a scrum master. They helped in making the path to completing out tasks as smooth as possible.

### Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
The tools we used in our project, TBCare, is django, react, and react-native. These are powerful frameworks that are both easy to learn and to maintain. However, in the agile manifesto, tools should **not** be the focus in a team. Instead, we need to focus more on the individual. Effective communication and collaboration in the team is what *truly* allows software development to succeed.

In the context of my team, we are currently working long distance. This is definitly harder, as face-to-face conversations are a more effective method of communication overall. The way my team adapted was to do google meetings whenever necessary. There are weekly (In real scrum application, daily) meetings, also known as standup meetings (SU). These meetings are for general progress and reporting on our own obstacles. Beside's standup meetings, we also sometimes conduct meetings to help eachother when one is having trouble.

We also often communicate in a messaging group, keeping eachother updated on progress and other things related to the project.

As a scrum master, I conducted an initial meeting sometime after the sprint planning phase. In this meeting I tried to breakdown the tasks that were given to us, and each member could choose whether or not they wanted to persue the task, based on their individual skill. I tried not to burden the member of my group too much, as we are all learning and should be just in eachothers workload.

### Working software over comprehensive documentation
Dated software development philosophies usually encourage writing documentation before writing code. This is to make sure the code is correct and does what is necessary. However, in the case of agile, it is more encouraged to have working software before having long documentation. Documentation is obviously good, but having working software that can be run by the customer - and in turn can give us insight into how well our software is - is better than writing long documentation right away. 

In the case of my group, oftentimes we try to finish the checklist of requirements given by the customer first. After they are all done, we collaborate together, doing things like QA testing to make sure the minute mistakes can be spotted and fixed. Even after that, sometimes some mistakes still are not fixed until the deadline day arrives. This is still okay, as these mistakes will be spotted by the customer (in this case they are spotted by our lecturer) during the sprint review, and are to be fixed after the sprint review. This sort of leeway is what makes agile a very good philosophy of software development as mistakes are not terrible punished.

### Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
The agile philosophy prefers customer centric development over product centric development. This means that instead of a contract depicting how the product should be, the customer and developer work together when developing a product. This is usually done by having many development cycles (also known as sprints!) when developing the product. After each sprint, the developer and customer communicate with eachother, to make sure that the product envisioned by the customer is also what the developer is envisioning. By having these continous cycles of development, guesswork done by the developers can be reduced significantly.

In the case of my group, we do exactly the same thing. We have sprints, which last around 3 weeks every time. Each sprint we are given new tasks by the customer, and we show our previous tasks to see if they meet the customers expectations. As a scrum master, during the sprint review process, I am expected to explain most if not all of what my group did.

### Responding to change over following a plan
The last value of agile is responding to change. The agile philosophy encouraged frequent reviewing of current progress, trying to find what is already good and what is potentially missing. What is already implemented could also not be up to expectations, and in that case can be changed accordingly. This constant feedback loop although might seem slow, actually speeds up the process of development due to minute details being caught early, before focus is taken away from it.

Not only is this value useful in the development process, but it is also useful in the learning process. My group and I are students. Although we are hard working ones, sometimes certain concepts are unknown to us and require extensive learning. The things we might have implemented may not be up to expectations due to our lack of knowledge, but the constant feedback allows us to learn what we did wrong, allowing us to prevent these mistakes in the future.

<br>

### Conclusion and final notes
The agile philosophy is very powerful and should be learnt by most software engineers if they want a smooth and easy development process. However, although the agile manifesto is very powerful, it should be taken as a mindset instead of a strict rule. Using this concepts and needed is more important than forcing yourself to use them all the time.
