## English
Flashback to a previous blog post, I explained the use of negative personas. However, in that blog post I forgot to give an example of a persona for the project I worked on known as TBCare. In this blog post, I want to give an example, albeit an example of a positive persona instead.

<br>

## Persona
To recap, a persona is a short description about certain people to find out their interests and opinions. This can help us infer whether or not these types of people are people we are interested in to use our service or not. People we feel should be interested are called potential buyers and the persona for them is called a **Buyer Persona**.

<br>

## How do make a persona?
Simple, all you need to do is research and collect data! Learn about the people around you, find out what interest them, and summerize all of it into a buyer persona. Use modern technology to help, such as survey tools, social media, interviewing, and more.

## Let's make a persona for TBCare!
TBCare is a volunteer based application meant to help data collection on patients with Tuberculosis. As such, let's imagine we have a fictional character named Budi, let's create a persona for him!

### 1. Facts about Budi
Budi is a 31 year old working in a cafe. He lives with his wife, and has no children. He lives in Padang, and hopes to open his own restaurant in the near future.

### 2. Interests and Values
Budi like to play football in his free time with his friends and co-workers. He recently played in a local football tournament and won second place.

Budi also likes to play music, and can play the guitar fairly well. He wants to play music often in the restaurant he plans to make build in the future. Other then that, he often plays music with his close friends on friday night in the neighbourhood.

### 3. Daily habit
* Budi gets up early to prepare for work. He helps his wife prepare his breakfast and lunch for the day
* Budi rides a motorbike to work
* He works for 8-9 hours a day
* After work, he likes to play with his close friends
* He goes home not too late at night

### 4. Goals
Budi plans on making a restaurant in his neighbourhood. He wants to help the people around him by providing cheap and accessible food for everyone.

<br>

## Conclusion
From the persona we made, we can see that Budi is fairly social and would be an excellent user for TBCare. From there, TBCare can be based around making the software as useful for people like Budi, and hope to encourage more people like him to use the software too.
